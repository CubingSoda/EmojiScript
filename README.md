# EmojiScript - A Better List of Emojis
EmojiScript is an AoPS script created by <a href='https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/546163' target='_blank'>forester2015</a> (with help from <a href='https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/539447' target='_blank'>Wukong</a>) in order to give AoPS a wider list of emojis to choose from. The idea of the script is simple; finding a certain string, such as `:pog:`, and replacing it with an `[img]` tag with its respective image; for example, `[img]www.imageURL.com[/img]`.
